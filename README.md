## Nubank Ruby

Get Nubank bills data using its public API's.

### Authentication

The authentication is manual, using the same flow described [here](https://github.com/andreroggeri/pynubank).

_Obs.: Only the QR Code auth flow was developed_

### TODO

+ Automate the authentication workflow
+ Possibility to pass bill URL dynamically  
+ Pass Bearer token dynamically
+ Use `refresh_token` after access_token expiration
